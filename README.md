# Sneɪk

Sneɪk is yet another snake style game written mainly because I realised I had never actually made a snake game before.

Sneɪk is built on the Godot Engine and attempts to do everything a good snake game is supposed to do.

## Current features
- The snake can move around the screen and eat nondescript blobs
- The snake grows after eating a nondescript blob
- The snake dies if it chomps on its own tail

## Possible future features
- Scorekeeping and high score table
- Speedups after eating X blobs
- Main menu and a pause menu
- Highly competitive two player mode
